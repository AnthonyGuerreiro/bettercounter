# BetterCounter

### A multi-purpose counter app

- Track good and bad habits
- Track when's the last time you did something (eg: water your plants, change your bedsheets, poop...)
- Count your lives in MtG

### Features

- Records the date of each individual counter increase, so upcoming versions can graph your data and calculate statistics.
- Your data is never sent to any server (except for Google's auto-backup, if it's enabled).
- Simple as hell and will stay this way.
